Early life and education
Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, he attended school in England.[1]

Career
Van Mentz joined the Reserve of Air Force Officers (RAFO) on a short service commission in 1937 after training at 4 Elementary & Reserve Flying Training School.[1] After a brief induction, he was commissioned Acting Pilot Officer from 24 November 1937. He then went to 8 Flying School on 11 December, before joining 213 Squadron in July 1938 at RAF Wittering, flying the Gauntlet Mk II.[1]
In September 1938 his commission with the RAFO came to an end and he was granted a short service commission on 19 October; he remained with 213 Squadron. In January 1939, 213 Squadron started receiving its first Hawker Hurricanes to replace the Gauntlets.[2]
In May 1940 van Mentz joined 504 (County of Nottingham) Squadron, a Hurricane squadron stationed at RAF Debden, but deployed to France. His first confirmed victory was on 14 May 1940, destroying a Junkers Ju 88 near the Albert Canal. This was followed by another confirmed and one unconfirmed on 15 May.[2]
On returning from France van Mentz moved to 222 Squadron, which was a Spitfire squadron. During the summer of 1940 he claimed three more victories and in October was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.[1] His DFC citation credits him with 6 victories:
On 30 October 1940 he damaged a Messerschmitt Bf 109 and on 30 November he destroyed a Dornier 17. Three days after receiving his DFC, he recorded the probable destruction of a Junkers Ju 88. This was followed by one enemy aircraft damaged on 2 February and one shared victory on 18 March.[4]

Death
On Saturday 26 April 1941, members of 222 Squadron, including van Mentz, went to the Ferry Inn, a popular pub near Horning. Three bombs fell nearby, one falling on the pub at 9.46pm. Van Mentz was one of 21 people killed in the blast.[5][1]
Van Mentz was buried in Brookwood Military Cemetery.[2]
