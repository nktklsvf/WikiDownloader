In July 1917, Atkisson was made a major in the National Army, and placed in command of the 30th Engineers, which became the 1st Gas Regiment. This regiment arrived in France on March 10, 1918, and eventually participated in the Aisne-Marne, St. Mihel, and Meuse-Argonne operations. In May 1918 he was made commandant of the Gas Service Experimental Field and Gas Defense School at Hanlon Field near Chaumont, France.
