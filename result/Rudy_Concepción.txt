Biography
Made his film debut in 1935, in Kundiman ng Puso (Song of Heart).
He was often paired romantically in films with the soprano Rosario Moreno, with whom he co-starred in Mapait na Lihim (1938). Concepcion himself was also a notable singer, with a distinctive singing style. Unusual for actors of the time, his own singing voice was used.
After six movies for Sampaguita Pictures, becoming one of its most bankable stars, Concepción signed with another production company Excelsior Pictures, where he made Pakiusap (opposite Rosario Moreno), Ikaw Pa Rin, Tunay na ina, and his last unfinished movie Mahal Pa Rin Kita. Pakiusap and Tunay na ina are two of only five Filipino films to survive World War II.

Death
He died of a peptic ulcer in 1940 during the shooting of Mahal Pa Rin Kita.[1]

Legacy & Honors
In the early 1950s, Pancho Magalona portrayed Rudy Concepción in a biographical movie called Kasaysayan ni Rudy, opposite Linda Estrella.
He was posthumously inducted to the Eastwood City Walk Of Fame on June 2008.
