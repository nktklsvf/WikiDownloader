George Thomas Armstrong

George Thomas Armstrong (February 19, 1881[1] â€“ September 9, 1941[2]) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1915 to 1920, as a member of the Liberal Party.[3]
Armstrong was born in Huntley Township,[2] Carleton County, Ontario, the son of Hugh Armstrong, and was educated at Manitoba public schools. He received a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Manitoba.[1] He was called to the Manitoba bar in 1905 and practised law in Manitou.[2] Armstrong was also a prominent freemason, and a member of the Church of England. In 1907, he married Margaret E. McTavish.[1] He was named a King's Counsel in 1920.[2]
He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1915 provincial election,[3] defeating Conservative W.H. Sharpe by 84 votes in the constituency of Manitou. The Liberals won a landslide majority in this election, and Armstrong served as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's government for the next five years.
He ran for re-election in the 1920 campaign[3] but finished third against Conservative John Ridley, losing by 284 votes.
In 1929, Armstrong was named county court judge for the southern judicial district of Manitoba.[2]
He died in Morden after an extended illness at the age of 60.[2]
