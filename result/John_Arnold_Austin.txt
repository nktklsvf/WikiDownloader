He detached from the tender and reported for duty on Augusta. On 4 December 1935, Austin was advanced to Chief Carpenters Mate (Chief Petty Officer).

Death at Pearl Harbor
On the morning of 7 December 1941, Chief Warrant Officer Austin was on board Oklahoma. The battleship, which was the first to be attacked by the Japanese on Battleship Row, capsized in only 15 minutes due to damage it received from torpedoes and bombs. Austin along with many crew members were trapped within the ship as it keeled over. After searching for a means of escape, he found a porthole beneath the surface that offered a way out. He assisted 15 sailors in escaping from the sunken Oklahoma. However Chief Warrant Officer Carpenter Austin failed to get out.
Austin's remains were originally among those buried in the Halawa Naval Cemetery and Nu'uanu Cemetery on Oahu. After the war concluded, those remains were disinterred as part of an effort to identify individuals. Still unidentified, his were among the remains of 45 crew members from the Oklahoma that were buried under a shared marker at the National Cemetery of the Pacific. New forensic technologies led to the resumption of efforts to identify those remains in 2015. Carpenter Austin's remains were identified by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency in September 2018.[1][2]
