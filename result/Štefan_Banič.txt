Štefan Banič

Štefan Banič (Slovak pronunciation: [ˈʃcɛfam ˈbaɲitʃ]; 23 November 1870 – 2 January 1941) was a Slovak inventor who patented an early parachute design.[1]
Born in Neštich (Hungarian: Jánostelek), Austria-Hungary (now part of Smolenice, Slovakia), Banič immigrated to the United States and worked as a coal miner in Greenville, Pennsylvania. After witnessing a plane crash in 1912, Banič constructed a prototype of a parachute in 1913 and was granted US patent, No. 1,108,484.[2]
The design which was radically different from others - it was a kind of umbrella attached to the body - but it is sometimes claimed that he successfully tested it in Washington, D.C. jumping first from a 15-storey building and subsequently from an airplane in 1914.[3][4] He donated his patent to the U.S. Army - but there is no evidence that it was ever used.
After World War I Banič returned to Czechoslovakia where he helped to explore the Driny karst cave in the foothills of the Little Carpathian Mountains, close to his hometown of Smolenice.[4]

Legacy
In 1997, US skydiver Slavo Mulik, also born in Slovakia, created the Stefan Banic Parachute Foundation[5] which offers bronze, silver and gold medal awards to individuals involved in events, promotions and/or celebrations of skydiving, in memory of Banic.[6]
In 2006, Slovak military paratroopers installed a memorial plaque at his birthplace in Smolenice.[7]
Trnava - Boleráz airport, near Smolenice, carries Banič's name.
