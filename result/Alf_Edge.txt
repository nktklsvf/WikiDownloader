Career
Edge was born in Stone, Staffordshire, and played for a Staffordshire side Goldenhill Wanderers before joining Stoke in 1885.[1] He became a useful forward for Stoke and scored five goals in a 10–1 win over Caernarfon Wanderers in the FA Cup during the 1886–87 season.[1] He was a member of the Stoke squad in their first two seasons in the Football League. He made his League debut on 8 September 1888, as a forward for Stoke in a 2–0 defeat by West Bromwich Albion at the Victoria Ground. His debut League goal was scored on 1 December 1888 in a 2–1 victory against Blackburn Rovers. In 1889–90 he played 19 of the 22 League matches played by Stoke scoring three goals.[2] Like the rest of the team Edge struggled in the first two seasons, Stoke failed to gain re-election and joined the Football Alliance. Stoke were much more successful as they finished as champions of the Alliance with Edge scoring 12 goals.[1]
Stoke re-gained their place in the Football League but Edge stayed in the Alliance signing for Manchester based Newton Heath.[1] Whilst at Newton Heath he was suspended by the FA for also playing for Nottingham Jardines Athletic. His ban was lifted after an investigation and he re-joined Stoke in 1892. He played one match for Stoke which came in a 7–1 victory against his old club Newton Heath.[1] He later went on to play for Northwich Victoria, Ardwick and finished his football career with Macclesfield.[1]
