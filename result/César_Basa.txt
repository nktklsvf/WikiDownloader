Early Years
Cesar Basa was born on June 21, 1915 to Fernando Basa and Rosario Tianko of Isabela, Negros Occidental. He finished his primary education in his home town, until their family moved to Manila where his parents enrolled him at the Ateneo de Manila University. He took up Bachelor of Science Major in Chemistry, and graduating in the class of 1939. In school he was known as a star player of their basketball team,[1] and was a swimmer.[2] Upon graduating from the ADMU, he joined the Philippine Army Flying School in Zablan Airfield in Camp Murphy, and received his commission as 2nd Lieutenant upon graduation in 1940.

Death
Basa's fight took place at Batangas Field on the morning of December 12, 1941 when 27 Japanese bombers and 17 fighter escorts raided the base.[3]
Six Filipino fighter pilots of the 6th Pursuit Squadron on Boeing P-26A "Peashooter" fighter planes, led by Captain Jesús Villamor, engaged the numerically superior enemy in aerial combat at 12,000 feet (3,700 m). Several dogfights ensued as Villamor and his men fought desperately to prevent the pack of bombers and their fighter escorts from reaching and bombing Lipa Airfield.[4]
Lieutenant Basa, who was already two hours airborne on an air-reconnaissance mission, rushed to the scene and attempted to join the aerial engagement with only 15 minutes' worth of fuel left on his P-26. While still half the distance away, he was intercepted by seven Japanese fighters and shot down. Although he was able to bring his aircraft back to Nichols Airfield and run for cover, but he was fatally wounded on his head as one of the Japanese fighters swooped down to strafe his aircraft. Lt. Victor Osias still attempted to rescue Basa, but expired in his arms.[1] This made him the first Filipino fighter-pilot casualty of war.
Captain Villamor and his pilots won the battle, with the only casualty being Basa. In recognition of his heroism, Lieutenant Basa was posthumously awarded the Silver Star.

Honors
