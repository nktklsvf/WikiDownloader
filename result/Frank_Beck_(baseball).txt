Frank Beck (baseball)

Frank J. Beck [born Frank J. Hengstebeck] (April 29, 1860 – February 8, 1941) was a right-handed starting pitcher and right fielder in Major League Baseball who played for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys (American Association) and Baltimore Monumentals (Union Association) during the 1884 season.
In one season career, Beck posted a 0–5 record with a 6.62 ERA in five pitching appearances (four complete games), giving up 42 runs (17 unearned) on 50 hits and 10 walks while striking out 18 in 34.0 innings of work. He also played four games at right field. As a hitter, he went 6-for-32 for a .188 average, including two doubles and two runs scored.
According to Baseball Reference, he was born in 1858 and his death date and place are unknown; other sources say the man who died in Michigan is not the same individual as the ballplayer.
