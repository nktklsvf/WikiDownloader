Playing career
He made over 100 appearances for Sheffield United and scored the third goal in their 4–1 defeat of Derby County in the 1899 FA Cup Final. Beer moved to Small Heath in January 1902 and the following season helped them to promotion back to the First Division. Later in his Birmingham career he played some games at centre-forward, which combined with his prowess at penalty-taking made him the club's joint leading scorer in the 1908–09 season.

He retired from football at the end of the next season, and emigrated to Australia where he became a sheep-farmer.
Returning to England in 1920, he became Birmingham's manager in 1923, taking charge of the team for four years in the First Division.
