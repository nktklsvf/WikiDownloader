Career
Corfield began his career with amateur side Toll End Wesley, before Football League side West Bromwich Albion in 1902. He made only eight first team appearances though, before quitting football at the request of his parents.[1]
He returned to the game in 1905 when he signed for Wolverhampton Wanderers. He made his Wolves debut on 21 October 1905 in a 2–1 win against Blackburn Rovers. He made 29 appearances during this season which saw the club suffer relegation for the first time. After a further 18 appearances during the following campaign, he found himself out of first time contention.[2]
