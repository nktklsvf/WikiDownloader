Edward Bausch

Edward Bausch (September 26, 1854 – July 30, 1941)[1] was an American engineer and business executive, who served as president of Bausch & Lomb Optical Company from 1926 to 1935.[2] He was awarded the twelfth ASME Medal in 1936. He served as chairman of the board until his death.[3]
Bausch was born in Rochester, New York to John Jacob Bausch and Barbara (Zimmermann) Bausch. He obtained his engineering degree from Cornell University in 1874. He was a brother of Delta Kappa Epsilon. He spent his life-long career at the optical supply business Bausch & Lomb, where he was president from 1926 to 1935,[2] and saw it “grow from an obscure spectacle shop to an industry of worldwide importance.”[4] One of his early accomplishments in the late 19th century was the development and production of the company's first commercial microscope.[5]
