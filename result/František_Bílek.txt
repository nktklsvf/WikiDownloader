František Bílek

František Bílek (6 November 1872, Chýnov, Bohemia – 13 October 1941, Chýnov) was a famous Czech Art Nouveau and Symbolist sculptor and architect.
Bílek attended the Academy of Fine Arts (AVU) in Prague. Due to his apparent colour-blindness he moved to Josef Mauder one year later (1888) and started to study sculpture. Given a scholarship offered by patron Vojtěch Lanna, he spent one year in Paris at the Académie Colarossi (prof. Jean Antoine Injalbert). After that, he lived in turns in Prague and in Chýnov. He was a member of the Mánes Union of Fine Arts from 1898 to 1912.
His works often reflect Biblical themes or have religious connotations. Though it was never completed, Bílek also worked on his National Monument reflecting Czech Hussite history and its perceived end at White Mountain.
He built his own villa in Hradčany which he requested be turned into a museum of his works after his death.
