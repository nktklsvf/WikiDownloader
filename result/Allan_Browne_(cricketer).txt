Chester Allan Browne (20 July 1888 – 12 October 1941) was a Barbadian cricketer who played first-class cricket for Barbados from 1907 to 1929. He represented West Indies in the days before West Indies played Test cricket.[1]
A batsman and occasional bowler, Browne played for West Indies against the touring English teams of 1910-11 and 1912-13. His only first-class century came when Barbados beat British Guiana in 1926–27, when he scored 131 not out, adding 216 for the eighth wicket with Barto Bartlett.[2]
