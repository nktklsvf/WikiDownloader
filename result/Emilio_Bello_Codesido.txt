Emilio Bello Codesido

Emilio Bello Codesido (13 July 1868, in Santiago – 3 March 1963)[1] was a Chilean lawyer, diplomat, deputy and President of the Government Junta that ruled Chile in 1925.
He was the son of Andrés Ricardo Bello, and grandson of Andres Bello, who authored the Civil Code of Chile. He did his early studies at the Colegio inglés, the Instituto Nacional and the Universidad de Chile, graduating as a lawyer in 1889. Due to his support of president José Manuel Balmaceda during the 1891 Chilean Civil War, he was forced to exile himself. He later was allowed to return and organized the Liberal Democratic Party in Valparaiso. He was several times minister and ambassador to Bolivia and México.
After the military coup of 1925, he was elected president of a Government Junta, composed of General Pedro Dartnell and Vice Admiral Carlos Ward, while expecting the return of the constitutional president, Arturo Alessandri Palma. He continued a very active political career until his death.
