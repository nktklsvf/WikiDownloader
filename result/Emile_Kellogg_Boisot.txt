Early life
Emile Kellogg Boisot was born in Dubuque, Iowa on February 26, 1859. He was the son of Louis Daniel Boisot (1823-1900) and Albertina Bush (1825-1889). He is a direct descendant of Jean-Baptiste Boisot who was a French abbot, bibliophile, and scholar.[3]
He was educated in the public and high schools of Dubuque, Iowa. His brother, Louis Boisot, Jr.(1856-1933), was a successful lawyer and vice-president of the First Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago. Louis wrote two books, “By-laws of Private Corporations” in 1892 and “Treatise on Mechanics' Liens” in 1897.[4]
In 1908, Boisot built a large two-story house on the block of 6th Avenue in La Grange, Illinois. In 1915, Henry Charles Lytton sold the Hillcroft English summer cottage on Lake Geneva, Wisconsin to Emile K. Boisot. Five years later, Boisot sold it to Arthur Leath of Elgin, who owned a chain of furniture stores. It is believed that the property acquired the name Hillcroft during this time. The house is unique in that it has a restored carriage house, gatehouse, greenhouse, and ice house. The Lake Geneva area, at this time, was an exclusive resort for wealthy Chicagoans.[5]
