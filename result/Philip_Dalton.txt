Early life and education
Dalton was born in Scotia, New York to William and Ida Dalton, and studied engineering at Cornell University's College of Engineering where he joined the ROTC. Upon graduation he received a commission as a Lieutenant of Field Artillery in the United States Army Reserve .[3] He continued his studies at Princeton University, where he received a Masters in Physics and Harvard after which he resigned his Army commission and joined the United States Naval Reserve. He received his wings at NAS Pensacola, and flew scout planes on the cruiser Northampton.[4]

Invention
While serving as US Naval Reserve Pilot, Dalton took an interest in slide-rule flight computers. His first models were designed in the early 1930s but it was not until 1932 that the first revision of the E-6B, originally known as the "Dalton Dead Reckoning Computer", came into existence.[2]

Death
On 30 October 1940, Dalton was recalled to active duty and assigned to Naval Air Station Anacostia, across the river from Washington, DC to help train naval aviators. On 24 July 1941, Dalton and Harry Lee Rogers, Jr., a student pilot, were killed when their aircraft crashed near Hybla Valley, Virginia.[citation needed] By this time, Dalton's devices were in widespread use by all aviation branches of the US and British military services.[5]
