In 1938, the Australian Government appointed Clemens to conduct an inquiry into the high cost of living in Canberra.[10] As part of the inquiry, Clemens was tasked with investigating why the costs of meat, vegetables, milk, groceries and other food in Canberra was much higher than in other nearby cities.[11] While the inquiry was not a Royal Commission, Clemens was still granted the powers to call witnesses, take evidence under oath, and demand the production of books and documents.[12] His report, delivered in March 1939,[13][14] in six sections, recommended administrative action against monopolies controlling supply in the ACT.[15]
Clemens died in Melbourne on 4 September 1941,[1] following an operation.[16]
