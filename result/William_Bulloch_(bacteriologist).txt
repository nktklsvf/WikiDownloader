William Bulloch (bacteriologist)

William Bulloch FRS (19 August 1868, in Aberdeen – 11 February 1941)[1] was a British bacteriologist and historian of bacteriology.[2][3]
After education at Old Aberdeen Grammar School (the 'Barn'), Bulloch in 1884 matriculated at the University of Aberdeen and graduated there M.B., M.Chir. in 1890. In 1890–1891 he worked as an assistant in a medical practice, but then returned to the University of Aberdeen in 1891 and worked under David James Hamilton on the pathology of the mammalian nervous system. Bulloch did post-graduate work at the University of Leipzig as a voluntary assistant to Birch-Hirschfeld and also studied at Vienna. In 1894 he returned briefly to the University of Aberdeen and received the higher medical qualification Doctor of Medicine. In 1894 he became an assistant to David Ferrier at King's College London and then an assistant to Victor Horsley at University College Hospital. Bulloch studied in Paris and Copenhagen and returned to the UK in 1895 to become the chief bacteriologist at the British Institute for Preventive Medicine's antitoxin laboratory at Sudbury. In 1897 he was appointed to a lectureship in bacteriology at the London Hospital. In 1917 his position as lecturer was given the name Goldsmith's Professor of Bacteriology in the University of London. Bulloch lectured in bacteriology at the University of London from 1897 until this official retirement in 1934 but he continued to do some laboratory work after his retirement.
He chaired the governing body of the Lister Institute and was an original member of the Medical Research Council. He was the author or co-author of more than 100 publications.
