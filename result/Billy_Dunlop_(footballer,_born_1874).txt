Life and playing career
Dunlop played for Sandyford, Hurlford, Annbank, Kilmarnock and Abercorn before being signed by Liverpool managers John McKenna and William Barclay in January 1895 for £35. He made his Liverpool debut in a Football League Division One match a 3-2 home defeat at the hands of Sunderland on the 25 March 1895 a season which saw Liverpool relegated from the top flight. The Left sided Full-Back enjoyed his second season a bit more as Liverpool gained promotion straight back to the First Division. Billy's early appearances for the Reds were sporadic but his loyalty and dedication paid off as he was to become a regular starter over a 10-year period which included the Anfield club's first ever Football League Championship win in 1901 a feat they, and he, were to repeat in 1906. Dunlop scored just twice for Liverpool his first coming on the 19 September 1903 in a 1-1 draw with Stoke at Anfield.
Dunlop earned 1 international cap when he represented Scotland against England on 7 April 1906, a game Scotland won 2-1 in a British International Championship match at Hampden Park Glasgow. Dunlop's Liverpool teammate Alex Raisbeck also played in the match captaining the Scots.
