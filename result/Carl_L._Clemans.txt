Carl L. Clemans

Carl Lane "Clem" Clemans (June 1, 1871 – October 7, 1941)[1] was an American football player and coach. He served as the head coach at the University of Washington in 1897 and at Stanford University in 1902, compiling a career record of 7–3.
Clemans played college football at Stanford in its first two years of existence, from 1891 to 1892, and served as the team's first captain.[2][3] Clemans played in the first two games of what would become the Big Game between Stanford and Cal, and scored the first two touchdowns in that series.[2]
Clemens was also notable as the founder of the Stanford Beta Chi chapter of the Sigma Nu fraternity, which was notable as the first major west coast chapter. He subsequently organized the University of California, Berkeley Beta Psi chapter.[4] [5]
