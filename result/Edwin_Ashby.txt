Edwin Ashby

Edwin Ashby (2 November 1861 â€“ 8 January 1941)[1] was an Adelaide based Australian property developer and a noted malacologist interested in chitons[1] and ornithologist.[2] He was a founding member of the South Australian Ornithological Association (SAOA) in 1899, and of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) in 1901 for which he served as president 1926. The avian genus Ashbyia (represented by the gibberbird Ashbyia lovensis) was named for him by Gregory Mathews.[3]
The garden of Ashby's property 'Wittunga' in the Adelaide Hills was developed botanically by his son, Arthur Keith Ashby, donated to the State of South Australia in 1965, and opened to the public in 1975 as Wittunga Botanic Garden.[4]
