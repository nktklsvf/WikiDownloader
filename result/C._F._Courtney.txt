History
Courtney was trained as a civil engineer in England, and was employed with the Fairbairn Engineering Co.[1] (perhaps William Fairbairn & Sons)
He had also worked as engineer for the Manchester Corporation
He worked on the Tharsis Sulphur and Copper Company's works in Tharsis, Spain, for 14 years.[2]
He was brought out from England to replace Randolph Adams as manager of Ashcroft's process at the Central Mine, Broken Hill, only recently taken over by the Sulphide Corporation. He arrived in Adelaide aboard Orizba in April 1897, and at Broken Hill in company with the Melbourne chairman J. S. Reid on 23 April.[3] Adams had been at the Central Mine for 51⁄2 years under three different owners, and was returning to the US.The new facility at Cockle Creek, near Newcastle, had just been brought into operation under Ashcroft's direction.[2]
Ashcroft's process for reducing zinc ore by electrolysis was abandoned as uneconomical, and around the same time an unrelated process, magnetic separation, was introduced to improve ore yield.[4] The company became a major producer of sulphuric acid and superphosphate.
Courtney became general manager for Australia of the Sulphide Corporation Ltd. in 1903, resident in Melbourne,[5] with a home "Granlahan" on Toorak Road, South Yarra; James Hebbard was his successor. In September 1922 Courtney left Melbourne to take up the position of the corporation's managing director in England.He resigned in 1940 due to ill-health and died the following year.[6]
