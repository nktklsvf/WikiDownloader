He married Vera Evelyn Ellen Sedgley (1898-1982) on 7 February 1920.[2] They had three daughters: twins,[3] Helen,[4] and Joan Mary,[5] and their younger sister, Annette.[6]
Two of his brothers, Cornelius and Leonard, were also gifted sportsmen, who also league football with Norwood and first-class cricket for South Australia.[7][8]

Employment
He was employed by the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company for 27 years, and for four years or so, was stationed overseas at various locations in East Asia, including Singapore, Cochin-China, and the Cocos Islands.

After spending some time in Tasmania, Chamberlain moved to Sydney at the age of 17 and played Australian rules football for Paddington. During this time, he twice represented New South Wales at interstate football.
Although initially playing soccer on his move to Perth in 1904, he abandoned soccer in 1906 and began playing Australian Rules once more with the Perth Football Club in the West Australian Football Association.
