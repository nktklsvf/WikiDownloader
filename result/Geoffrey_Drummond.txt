Geoffrey Drummond

Lieutenant-Commander Geoffrey Heneage Drummond VC (25 January 1886 â€“ 21 April 1941) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.
Drummond was born on 25 January 1886. He was 32 years old, and a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during the First World War, and was awarded the VC for his part in the Second Ostend Raid.
On 9/10 May 1918 at Ostend, Belgium, Lieutenant Drummond commanding HMML (Motor Launch) 254, volunteered for rescue work and was following HMS Vindictive to the harbour when a shell burst on board killing an officer and a deck hand and badly wounding the coxswain and Lieutenant Drummond. Notwithstanding his wounds, this officer brought M.L. 254 alongside Vindictive and then took off two officers and 38 men, some of whom were killed or wounded while embarking. He retained consciousness long enough to back his vessel away from the piers and towards the open sea before collapsing exhausted from his wounds.[1][2]
Drummond married Maude Aylmer Tindal Bosanquet (d 27 Sept, 1967) on 2 July 1918.
Despite suffering from his severe wounds received in his VC action, Drummond served with the Royal Naval Patrol Service in World War II.
He died on 21 April 1941 from a fall.[3][4]
His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.
