Millice Culpin

Millice Culpin (1 December 1846 – 1 September 1941) was an Australian politician. Born in Hertfordshire, England, he was educated at Alleynes Grammar School and then the University of Edinburgh, after which he became a doctor. He migrated to Australia in 1891. In 1903, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Labor member for Brisbane after the appearance of a second Protectionist candidate allowed him to defeat sitting member Thomas Macdonald-Paterson.[1] Culpin was defeated in 1906 and became a suburban doctor in Brisbane. He died there in 1941[2] and was buried in Toowong Cemetery.[3]
