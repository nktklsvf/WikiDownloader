Ullie Akerstrom

Ullie R. Akerstrom (March 17, 1864 â€“ August 10, 1941), born Ulrika Akerstrom, was an American actress, dancer, playwright, and vaudeville performer. (Her gravesite in New York gives her birth year as 1870. Her career beginning in the mid-1880s makes the earlier published date[1] more plausible.)
