Karl Decker (journalist)

Karl Decker, pen name Charles Duval, (died 1941, age 73) was a journalist in the United States who worked for William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal. He covered events leading up to the Spanish American War and helped Evangelina Cosio y Cisneros escape from a Spanish prison.[1][2][3] Controversy over the events ensued. Amy Ephron wrote about the events in her book White Rose (2000).[4]
Before the war, Decker collaborated with filmmaker William C. Paley, covering a funeral procession for those killed on the U.S.S. Maine.
After the war, Decker returned to Cuba in 1899. He covered severe storm aftermath. He also wrote about Cuba in 1933.[5]
Later in his career, while working at the Saturday Evening Post, he made claims about who was responsible for the theft of the Mona Lisa.[6]
