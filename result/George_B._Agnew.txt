George Bliss Agnew (1868 – June 21, 1941) was an American politician from New York.

He graduated from Princeton University in 1891.
Agnew was a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 27th D.) in 1903, 1904, 1905 and 1906.
He was a member of the New York State Senate (17th D.) from 1907 to 1910, sitting in the 130th, 131st, 132nd and 133rd New York State Legislatures.
In 1908, he co-sponsored, with Assemblyman Merwin K. Hart, the Hart–Agnew Law, an anti-horse-race-track-gambling bill which led to a total shutdown of horse-racing in the State of New York.
Agnew was defeated by John G. Saxe II in the November 8, 1910 election in a district that was Republican by a great majority.[1]
