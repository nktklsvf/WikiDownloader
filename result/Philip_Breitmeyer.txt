Biography
Philip Breitmeyer was born in Detroit on May 13, 1864, the son of John and Fredericka Schneider Breitmeyer.[1][2] He was educated in the public schools of the city, and joined the family florist business, John Breitmeyer & Sons.[1] He soon became president of the firm, and after his father's death bought out his brothers to become sole owner of the firm.[2] The business grew rapidly, and they built a new building to house the firm, now the Breitmeyer-Tobin Building.[1]
Breitmeyer was one of the organizers, and served as president, of Florists' Telegraph Delivery (now Florists' Transworld Delivery, or FTD).[2] He was president of the American Society of Florists,[2] president of the Michigan Cut Flower Exchange, vice-president of the German-American Bank[1] director of the Lohrman Seed Company, and president of the Detroit National Fire Insurance Company.[2]
In 1886, Breitmeyer married Katie Grass. The couple had three children, Philip Jr, Harry G. and Katherine.[1][2]

Politics
Breitmeyer was appointed by George P. Codd as Commissioner of Parks and Boulevards for the city of Detroit,[1] a position he held for two years.[2] So well did he perform that he was nominated as the Republican candidate for mayor, and was elected for a term in 1909-1910.[1]
Breitmeyer ran again for mayor in 1933, but was soundly defeated by James Couzens's son Frank.[3] He also served for two years, 1938-1939, on the Detroit City Council.[4]
Philip Breitmeyer died on November 8, 1941.[5]
