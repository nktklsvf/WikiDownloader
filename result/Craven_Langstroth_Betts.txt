Craven Langstroth Betts

Craven Langstroth Betts (1853–1941) was a Canadian poet and author.[1]
A seller of law books[2] from Nova Scotia, the Maritimes- one of the first people from there to settle in New York- Betts was a friend and patron of the American poet Edwin Arlington Robinson;[3] he served as his 'banker', cashing cheques that came from the dwindling Robinson estate at Maine, as well as lending him small sums money. The two men were frequent drinking and dining companions,[4] and in the summers of 1900 and 1901, lived together at Betts's house in Manhattan whilst his mother and aunt were away in cooler climes.[5] Their friendship lasted throughout Robinson's life; eventual success led him to more than repay Betts's financial support, presenting him with original manuscripts to sell, and leaving him $1,000 in his will.[6]
