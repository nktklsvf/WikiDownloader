Early life
Robert Alexander was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on October 17, 1863. His parents were Judge and Mrs. William Alexander.[1] His father had been Justice of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City and the Court of Appeals of the State of Maryland.
Alexander studied law in the offices of J. B. and Edwin H. Brown in Centreville, Maryland. He attained admission to the bar, but decided against a legal career, instead enlisting in the United States Army's 4th Infantry Regiment as a private on April 7, 1886.[2]

Career
In 1887, he became the first sergeant of his company, and in 1889 received a promotion to second lieutenant.[1]
As he rose through the ranks he took part in the American Indian Wars, served in Puerto Rico during the Spanish–American War, and on the Texas–Mexico border during the Pancho Villa Expedition.
When the United States joined the Allied forces in World War I, Alexander proved his valor and was able to rise through the ranks. He was also given the responsibility of inspector general in the Zone of Communications from November 1917 to February 1918. Alexander was promoted to brigadier general in February 1918 and then to major general in August 1918.[1]
From the headquarters of the 77th Division in France, Alexander was one of the officers who reported on the Lost Battalion incident. A group of around 500 soldiers, in nine companies, had disappeared after going into the Argonne Forest expecting American and French Allied troops to meet them. This had followed an American attack on German forces and, with Major Charles White Whittlesey leading the group, the men found that the French troops had been stalled. As a result, the battalion was cut off by the Germans who surprised them and suffered large losses with only 197 men coming out of the ravine. In the report he states:
In France, he commanded the 41st Infantry Division, 63rd Infantry Brigade, and 77th Infantry Division.[1]
After the war, he returned to the rank of colonel and commanded the 3rd Field Artillery Brigade.[4]
In 1919, Alexander received the honorary degree of LL.D. from St. John's College of Annapolis, Maryland.[5]
He retired in 1927 at the rank of major general.[1]
He authored a memoir, 1931's Memories of the World War, 1917–1918. Also in 1931, Alexander received an honorary LL.D. from the College of Puget Sound.[6]

Masonry
He was a freemason.[7]

Personal life
He married Mollie Augur Thomas (1871–1953), who was the daughter of Brigadier General Earl D. Thomas in 1892. Together, they had two sons: William Dennison (1893–1978) and Robert (1900–1979). William Dennison became a colonel and Robert Jr. became a lieutenant colonel of the United States Army and died within one year of each other.

Death
He died in Manhattan on August 25, 1941.[1] He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.[8]
