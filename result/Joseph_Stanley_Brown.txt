Joseph Stanley Brown

Joseph Stanley Brown served as private secretary to the twentieth President of the United States, James A. Garfield. He would completely devote himself to Garfield, as seen when Garfield asked "What can I do for you?" at their first meeting, prompting Brown to respond, " "It's not what you can do for me, but what I can do for you, sir." Brown would serve as Garfield's secretary during his brief presidency, controlling the office-seekers that ran rampant due to the spoils system, which Garfield's vice president Chester Arthur would eventually reform.[1] He married President Garfield's daughter Mary "Mollie" Garfield in 1888.[2][3]
