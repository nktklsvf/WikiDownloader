Biography
Braunholtz went to school in Hildesheim and Hanover and then studied in Tübingen (1878–1879) and Berlin (1879–1883). In 1883 he received from the Humboldt University of Berlin his doctorate (Promotion) with a dissertation on the origin and distribution of non-Christian tales that were forerunners to the Christian parable of Barlaam and Josaphat. He then studied at the University of Paris. At the University of Cambridge, he was from 1884 to 1900 a university lecturer in French and from 1900 to 1939 a reader in Romance languages. Braunholtz was awarded an MA Hon. causa in 1886 from King's College, Cambridge, where he was made a Fellow. For some years he was a sub-editor for the Modern Language Review.[1]
He married and had issue.[1] Braunholtz was the brother-in-law and colleague of Karl Hermann Breul (1860–1932), the first Germanist at the University of Cambridge. Both Braunholtz and Breul became academics at the University of Cambridge in 1884.
