Biography
Early life
Henri Dobler was born in 1863 in Switzerland. His parents sold silk and textiles in Marseille.[1]
Adult life
He started his career in the French Army.[1] In 1895, he gave up on his military ambitions and focused on art.[1] He started collecting art, wrote a poetry book, and started painting.[1] His paintings dealt with mythology and romanticism.[1] However, it is thought that his paintings were not very successful because of a personal and vocal rift he had with Paul Cézanne, whose work he called "dirty paintings" and "the biggest scam of the century".[1]
In 1906, he purchased the Pavillon Vendôme in Aix-en-Provence and refurbished it until 1914.[1][2][3][4][5] He also took pains to add furniture specifically from Provence to the house.[1] Meanwhile, he also wrote books about the history of architecture in Aix-en-Provence and Marseille.[6]
Hubert de Courcy painted his portrait.[1]
Death
He died in 1941.
