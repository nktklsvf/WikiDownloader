Career
In April 1912, he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Kent.[1] He was also a Justice of the peace for North Aylesford. Professionally, he was the Director of the Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers, Ltd.[2]
Anderson was elected unopposed in August 1918 to succeed Francis Bennett-Goldney,[3] who was killed in a motoring accident while in France a month prior.[4] Anderson was seen a temporary replacement until the following General Election, as he was approved by the two feuding Conservative groups in Canterbury.[5]
He retired at the dissolution three months later, becoming one of the shortest serving MPs on record. He never made a speech or asked a question, although he voted in 12 divisions.
For more than twenty years he was Honorary Treasurer of Canterbury Diocesan Board of Finance.[6] He was also involved in the church in a variety of roles, including as a lay reader, Church Councillor and a Churchwarden.[6]

Death
Anderson died at Canterbury on 26 March 1941,[6] aged 86.[7] He left £144,858,[8] and at the time of his death he was married with a son and a daughter.[6]
