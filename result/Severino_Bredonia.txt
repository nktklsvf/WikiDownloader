Severino Bredonia

In 1941 during World War II Severino Bredonia, a constable of the Philippine Scout or Philippine Constabulary, was ordered to defend Carmen Bridge in Pangasinan on Luzon Island, against the advancing Japanese. His instructions were to delay the Japanese troops so that Allied aircraft located at Carmen Airport could take off.
Bredonia and his detachment fought to defend the Carmen Bridge, but due to insufficient weapons and a lack of ammunition, and the large contingent of attacking Japanese, his forces were overpowered and either captured or killed in action. Those taken prisoner were later executed. After being forced to crawl at gunpoint from the Municipal Hall of Sto. Tomas' Pangasinan to the foot of Carmen Bridge, Bredonia was ordered to dig a fox hole. When he completed this, his hands were tied behind his back, and he was stabbed in the back with bayonets by the Japanese soldiers. The Japanese commander finally shot him in the head, with the fox hole serving as his grave.
Bredonia had two brothers, Apolinario (the eldest) and Rufino, and a sister, Eugenia. His brother Rufino lived and died in Sitio Alcalde, Tibig, Silang Cavite. Severino's seven children were Buenaventura, Juanito, Alejandro, Eufemia Bredonia-Queliza, Eugenia Bredonia-Mina, Ben Agbayani and Consuelo Agbayani.
