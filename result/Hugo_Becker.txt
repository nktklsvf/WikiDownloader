Biography
He was born in 1863 in Strasbourg; his father Jean Becker was a famous violinist. His father tried teaching him violin at the age of six, but the young Becker loved cello, and switched over at the age of nine. By age fifteen he was touring with a string quartet made up of him, his father, sister, and brother. He had also become a leading cellist in the court orchestra in Mannheim.[1]
In 1884, Becker was appointed solo cellist with the Frankfurt Opera Orchestra, and the following year became the leading cello teacher at the Frankfurt Hoch Conservatory. From 1909 to 1929, he was professor of cello at the Hochschule für Musik in Berlin;[2] among his students was George Georgescu, who would replace him as cellist in the Marteau Quartet before forsaking the cello for the conductor's podium on account of a hand injury.[3] Later, Georgescu would remark, "All I know, I learned from Hugo Becker."[4]
During this time Becker also toured extensively and played chamber music with Eugène Ysaÿe and Ferruccio Busoni in a piano trio.,[1] and later with Artur Schnabel and Carl Flesch as the third Schnabel Trio[2] between 1914 and 1921.
He died on 30 July 1941.

Legacy
He owned two Stradivarius cellos: the 1700 Cristiani and another one built in 1719 now known as the Becker.[1]
