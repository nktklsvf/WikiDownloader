Change of name
He enlisted in the first AIF under the name of James Davidson (the reason for this decision has never been explained); and, it seems, he went under that name for the rest of his life.[2]

Family
The son of Scottish migrants, William Dougall (1855-1929)[3] and Mary Dougall (1856-1904), née Mitchell,[4] he was born in Melbourne on 22 May 1884.[5] He married Rita Isobel Ridley (1894-), née Law (under the name "Andrew William Dougall") in South Australia in 1931.[6]
One brother, Lieutenant Norman Dougall (1887-1917) — who attended Geelong College (1898-1902), and served in the First AIF, was also awarded the Military Cross in 1917 ("for conspicuus gallantry and devotion to duty") — was killed in action at Bullecourt on 6 May 1917.[7]
A second brother, Major John Mitchell Dougall (1879-1926), who had served with the 79th Cameron Highlanders in the Boer War, also served in the First AIF.[8][9][10]

Education
He attended Geelong College.[11][12][13] He studied at the University of Melbourne for at least one term.[14]

Football
He played two First XVIII matches for Carlton Football Club: on 12 July 1902 (round 11), on the wing, against Melbourne, and, in the last of the home-and-away matches for the season, on 2 August 1902 (round 14), in the forward pocket, against Collingwood. He competed as a half-miler for Coburg Harriers for many years.[15]

Military service
He enlisted in the First AIF, on 30 August 1914; and, among the first to land at Gallipoli in 25 April 1915, he sustained a bullet wound in his right forearm (he was removed to Cairo for treatment, and rejoined his regiment at Gallipoli on 22 June 1915).[16][17] With the rank of Lieutenant (he was a Temporary Captain), he was awarded the Military Cross in 1919.[18][19]

Death
He died in Hilton, South Australia on 11 November 1941. His death notice identified him as "James Davidson".[20]
