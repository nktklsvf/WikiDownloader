Abram Belenky

Abram Yakovlevich Belenky (Khatskelevich) (Russian: Абра́м Я́ковлевич Бе́ленький) (1882 or 1883 – 16 October 1941) was a Russian revolutionary of a Jewish origin, Bolshevik and a major functionary of the Soviet secret police (Cheka / OGPU / NKVD), born in Swierżań, Russian Emipre.[1][2] In 1919-24 he was a head of V.I. Lenin security later promoted to major of NKVD.[3]
On 9 May 1938 Belenky was arrested and accused of having taken part in a counter-revolutionary plot organized by former NKVD officers, including Genrikh Yagoda. He was sentenced by the Special Council of the NKVD (OSO) to five years of Gulag imprisonment. In 1940 this sentence was cancelled[4] and his case was re-opened, with the eventual outcome that he was executed by firing-squad on 16 October 1941.
