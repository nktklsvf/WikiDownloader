Ron Barassi Sr.

Ronald James Barassi (24 October 1913 – 31 July 1941) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL). His grandfather came from Italy and Ron was the father of Hall of Famer Ron Barassi Jr. who was signed to Melbourne under the Father-Son Rule.
Originally from Castlemaine, Barassi was a rover and made his debut for Melbourne in 1936. His final league match was Melbourne's victorious 1940 Grand Final which he started as the 19th man.
Like many other footballers from the Melbourne Football Club he joined the army soon after.[1] Serving as part of Australia's campaign in North Africa, he was killed in action at Tobruk in 1941, the first VFL footballer to lose his life in the conflict.
