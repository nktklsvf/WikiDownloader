Charles Binet-Sanglé

Charles Binet-Sanglé (4 July 1868 – 14 November 1941) was a French military doctor and psychologist, who notably was the first to publicly question the mental health of Jesus, which he did in his book La Folie de Jésus.[1][2]
His other most influential work, Le Haras Humain (The Human Stud-Farm) suggested that euthanasia was necessary in some cases, and that a eugenic institute must be founded to encourage education of the improvement for the human race.[3] The book was heavily censored in France.[4]
He was decorated Knight of the Legion of Honour in 1912 and promoted Officer of the same order in 1922.[5]
