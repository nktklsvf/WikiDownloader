Playing career
Born in Cornwall, Ontario, Angus became a member of the Cornwall Hockey Club in 1901. He played for the club for three seasons, in the Southern Ontario Hockey Association and in the first year of the Federal Amateur Hockey League (FAHL) in 1903–04. In 1904–05, he joined the Ottawa Hockey Club during its reign as Stanley Cup champions. He played for Ottawa only that one season. At the time, professional lacrosse paid better than ice hockey, so he concentrated on his lacrosse career. He did play one more season of ice hockey for the Cornwall Hockey Club in 1908-09 in the FAHL.

Lacrosse career
Allen began playing senior lacrosse in Ontario, ca. 1898-99 for the Ottawa Capitals. In 1908 he went west on tour with the Ottawa team and then stayed afterwards in Vancouver. He played professional lacrosse with the Vancouver Lacrosse Club between 1909 and 1915. He went overseas after the 1913 season but returned in 1915 for one final season with Vancouver. In six seasons (1909–1913; 1915) with Vancouver, he played in 56 games and scored a total of 38 goals. He was primarily a 'home' (midfield) player but halfway through his final season he moved up to the 'outside home' position on the attack.
Allen was inducted into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame as a field player in 1966[2].
