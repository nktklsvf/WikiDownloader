William Barefoot

William Barefoot (1872 – November 1941) was a notable local politician in south-east London during the early part of the 20th century.
He was a born in Frances Street, Woolwich, and lived for a time in Griffin Street, Plumstead.[1]
He served as a local councillor in Eltham for 33 years, was mayor of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich three times (1925–1927), and served on the national executive committee of the Labour Party. In 1928, he wrote Twenty-five years' history of the Woolwich Labour Party, 1903–1928, published by the "Kentish Independent" Printing Works. He died from a heart attack suffered in the council chamber at Woolwich town hall.
He is commemorated by a plaque in Well Hall Pleasaunce, erected in September 1942, which reads: "He loved nature and his efforts to beautify Woolwich are reflected in the creation of this Pleasaunce" (Barefoot had been instrumental in the creation of the Pleasaunce as a public park and gardens).[2][1] A small park, William Barefoot Gardens in Alliance Road, Plumstead,[3] and William Barefoot Drive on the Coldharbour Estate are also named after him.
