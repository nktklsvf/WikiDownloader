Svetozar Džanić

Svetozar Džanić (1 April 1917 – 18 June 1941) was a footballer who played for the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Banovina of Croatia and Independent State of Croatia national teams. He was also known as Milan or Cveta.[1]
Born during the latter part of World War I in a small Syrmian village, Đanić started playing football with Novi Sad outfit FK Slavija. At the age of 17, he moved to their more established crosstown rivals FK Vojvodina and immediately established himself in the first team.
Two years later, in 1936, together with brother Miran, he moved to Zagreb in pursuit of university studies. Parallel to studies he also played football with HŠK Građanski, spending the 1936/37 season with them.
Đanić's studies then took him to Czechoslovakia for a year where he also played one season for SK Židenice (5 league starts, 3 goals - 1937/38) and one season for SK Viktoria Plzeň (1938/39).
Returning to Zagreb he also continued playing for Građanski, eventually earning a callup to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia national team in 1940. His debut came on 3 November 1940 versus Germany in Zagreb. He would only play in three matches before the Nazi Germany invasion and quick dismemberment of Yugoslavia put an end to Yugoslav football activities. Đanić's last match in Yugoslavia jersey was also Kingdom of Yugoslavia's last ever outing - a match versus Hungary on 23 March 1941 in Belgrade.
Soon after the Royal Yugoslav Army defeat, and the establishment of Croatian Nazi-puppet state (NDH) under collaborationist Ustashe regime, Đanić played first game for NDH football team in Vienna on 15 June 1941 versus Nazi Germany. Upon returning to Zagreb, he was immediately put on trial by Ustashe under the accusation that he collaborated with the communists. After a quick show trial, Đanić was executed three days later on 18 June 1941.
