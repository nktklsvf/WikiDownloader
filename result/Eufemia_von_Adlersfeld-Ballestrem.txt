Eufemia von Adlersfeld-Ballestrem

Eufemia von Adlersfeld-Ballestrem (1854–1941) was a German aristocratic novelist. She was born in Ratibor, Upper Silesia, but later settled in Munich. She was one of the few German female writers of the 19th century who did not use a pseudonym.
As a child, she had singing lessons from the Dresden soprano Jenny Bürde-Ney, and herself developed 'a beautiful soprano voice of rare proportions'. [1]
