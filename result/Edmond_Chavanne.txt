Edmond Chavanne

Edmond Auguste M. Chavanne (August 6, 1877 – 1941) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head coach at LSU Tigers football for two seasons, 1898 and 1900, compiling a career record of 3–2.[1] John P. Gregg coached the team in 1899. Chavanne was the first LSU football coach to have graduated from LSU. He is the only player-coach in LSU football history. The 1898 season was delayed due to a yellow fever outbreak throughout the South. Prior to the season starting, LSU's previous football coach, Allen Jeardeau, had departed the school and the coaching position. Since the school had not made any provision to name a replacement coach, the job was left to Chavanne, the team's captain.[2] Chavanne graduated from LSU in 1898. He had previously played on the school's football team from 1896-1898. He was named as Commandant of Cadets at LSU in 1899, and football coach in 1900.[3]
