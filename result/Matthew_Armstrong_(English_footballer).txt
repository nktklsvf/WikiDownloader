Matthew Armstrong (English footballer)

Matthew Armstrong (26 January 1919 – 12 July 1941) was an English footballer who made 38 appearances in the Football League playing as a wing half for Darlington in the 1930s.[1] He joined Aston Villa in 1939 – a preview in the Daily Express highlighted him as one of "two young defenders who look as if they have that certain Soccer something"[5] – but he never played for Villa's first team before the league was abandoned for the duration of the Second World War.[1][6]
Armstrong was killed during the Second World War while serving in 149 Field Ambulance, Royal Army Medical Corps. He was 22, and is commemorated on the Brookwood Memorial.[3]
