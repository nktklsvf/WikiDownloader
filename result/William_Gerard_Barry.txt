Career
The son of a magistrate, Barry was born in Ballyadam, Carrigtwohill, County Cork. He enrolled in Cork's Crawford School of Art and studied there under Henry Jones Thaddeus from 1881 to 1883. Thaddeus advised Barry to travel to Paris where he continued his training at Académie Julian under Le Febre, Boulanger and Carolus Duran. His initial success came in 1887 when he received a £30 Taylor prize after sending a painting to the Royal Dublin Society from Étaples. He traveled extensively, including visits to the United States and Canada.[1] Barry was living in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, in southwest France during the German occupation of World War II. He died when a bomb went off near his home on 9 September 1941.[2]
