Football career
Blyth was born in Glenbuck, and was a member of the Glenbuck Cherrypickers, playing alongside members of his extended family. From there he was scouted by the Glasgow Rangers, playing as a wing-half (1891–1894), followed by Preston North End (1894–1899) and Portsmouth (1899–1901).[2]
He became player–manager of Portsmouth in 1901, winning the 1901-02 Southern League title. After retiring from his post as manager, he later served Portsmouth as director and chairman. According to the Portsmouth Evening News, Blyth was "the only man to rise from professional player to be chairman of his club through all the intermediate positions: Captain, player-manager, manager, director, and vice-chairman."[2]

Personal life and family
Blyth grew up in a poor mining village which managed to produce a number of football stars. Five of his nephews played professionally, including future Liverpool manager Bill Shankly OBE and Bob Shankly, sons of his sister, Barbara.[2] His brother William Blyth also played for Portsmouth.[4]
He married Isabella Taylor,[5] with whom he had daughters Mary and Janet, and a son, Robert Blyth, who played for both Portsmouth and Southampton in the 1920s.[6][2]
Blyth was also a licensee and operated several hotels in Portsmouth. He died peacefully at St James' Hospital, Portsmouth, in 1941.[3][2]
