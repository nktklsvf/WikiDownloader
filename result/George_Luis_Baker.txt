George Luis Baker

George Luis Baker (1868–1941) was an American businessman and politician who served as mayor of Portland, Oregon, from 1917 to 1933.[1]
Baker was born in The Dalles and attended school in California. Working in the theatrical business, Baker started the Baker Stock Company at the Baker Theater at Third and Yamhill Streets in Portland. He spent nine years as a member of the city council and two years as Commissioner of Public Affairs before being elected mayor.[2]
The October 18, 2012 edition of the Portland Mercury listed Baker as the Second Worst Mayor in Portland history because he had "proudly posed for a photo shoot with hooded members of the Ku Klux Klan and felt his greatest accomplishment of mayor was 'removal of subversives'," particularly members of the Industrial Workers of the World union.[3]
Baker died on May 16, 1941.[1]
