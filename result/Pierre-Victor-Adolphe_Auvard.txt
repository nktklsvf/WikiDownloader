Pierre-Victor-Adolphe Auvard

Pierre-Victor-Adolphe Auvard (name sometimes given as Pierre-Victor Alfred Auvard in medical literature); (8 August 1855 – 1941) was a French obstetrician and gynecologist born in the department of Corrèze.
He studied medicine in Paris, and in 1879 became interne des hôpitaux. In 1882 he furthered his studies in Germany (Leipzig, Dresden, Berlin), and in 1884 received his doctorate with a thesis titled De la pince à os et du cranioclaste. Later he maintained a private OB/GYN clinic in Paris.
During the 1880s, he introduced the "Auvard couveuse", an inexpensive incubator that became widely popular in the latter part of the 19th century. Other eponyms in the field of obstetrics that bear his name are: "Auvard maneuver" - a procedure for extraction of the placenta; "Auvard's vaginal speculum", and "Auvard's basiotribe" - an instrument that is a combination of a craniotomy forceps and a cranioclast.
