Charles Cerutty

Charles John Cerutty CMG (25 November 1870 – 19 January 1941) was a senior Australian public servant. He was Commonwealth Auditor-General between 1926 and 1935.

Life and career
Cerutty was born in Sale, Victoria on 25 November 1870.[1]
Cerutty entered the Victorian Public Service in 1888, and was transferred to the Commonwealth Public Service in 1901, the year of Federation.[2] His first Commonwealth position was as a sub-accountant in the Department of the Treasury.[3]
In June 1926, Cerutty was appointed the Commonwealth Auditor-General. He delivered his final audit report in October 1935.[4] During his time as Auditor-General, he was outspoken often—particularly in regard to accounting methods, and the increasing funds spent on the old-age and invalid pension systems.[4] Following his final report, strong representations were made by some Members of Parliament that his furlough pay should be cancelled in punishment.[5] Cerutty declined to withdraw his report, stating that he had a job to do and had merely placed the facts before all concerned.[6]
During his tenure as Auditor-General, Cerutty strongly opposed the move of his office from Melbourne to Sydney, arguing that its work would be less efficient and economical to carry out from Canberra.[7]
Cerutty died in Caulfield, Melbourne on 19 January 1941.[8]

Awards
Cerutty was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1927.[9]
