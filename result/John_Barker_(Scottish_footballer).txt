John Barker (Scottish footballer)

John Bell Barker (28 June 1869 â€“ 29 June 1941) was a Scottish footballer who played for Linthouse, Rangers and the Scotland national team in the 1890s.
Barker was born in Govan, Glasgow, in 1869, the son of John Barker and Margaret Trench Barker.[1] His father worked as a fitter in the shipbuilding industry, which became a major industry in Govan in the mid-19th century.[3]
Barker joined Rangers from Linthouse in 1892 and made an immediate impact by scoring 3 goals in his first 5 appearances. He achieved a similar impact at international level, scoring a hat-trick in the first of his two Scotland caps against Wales in March 1893. He scored in his second, and what proved to be his last Scotland appearance again against Wales a year later in a 5-2 win. He scored for Rangers in their 1894 Scottish Cup triumph against Celtic but, despite continued success, left the club in 1896.

Later life
Barker also made a career in Govan's ship building industry, working as a draughtsman. He died in his hometown of lymphoma in 1941, one day after his 72nd birthday. He was survived by his wife, Ellen Smith Reid, and a daughter, Ellen Reid Barker.[2]
