Frederick Boardman

Frederick Stanley Boardman (February 18, 1851 – April 12, 1941) was an American baseball player. Boardman was born in 1851 in St. Joseph, Missouri.[1] According to baseball historian David Nemec, he was an "auxiliary player" in Chicago for many years.[2] He appeared in one game in Major League Baseball as a right fielder for the Baltimore Canaries in the National Association during the 1874 baseball season.[1] His lone appearance with the Canaries came about when the team visited Chicago and was in need of an outfielder.[2] The Chicago White Stockings won the game by a 4-0 score.[3] During the 1875 season, he worked as an umpire in the National Association.[2] He died in 1941 in Indianapolis, at age 90.[1]
